If you are a photographer who cares about color accuracy and consistency, you might want to consider using a color calibration tool like the Spyder Checkr 24. This is a target color card that helps you to correct the color of your image files for different camera and lens combinations. In this article, we will show you how to use the Spyder Checkr 24 and its software to achieve precise and reliable color across all your photos.
 
## What is Spyder Checkr 24?
 
Spyder Checkr 24 is a product from Datacolor, a company that specializes in color management solutions. It is a color card that contains 24 standard color patches, including six skin tones, six gray tones, and twelve chromatic colors. The color patches are designed to match the colors of natural objects, such as flowers, foliage, and skin. The Spyder Checkr 24 also comes with a sleeve that protects it from dust and damage.

The purpose of the Spyder Checkr 24 is to help you correct the color of your image files for different camera and lens combinations. Different cameras and lenses can produce different color renditions of the same scene, depending on factors such as sensor type, white balance setting, lighting condition, and lens coating. By including the Spyder Checkr 24 in one of your photos, you can use its software to create a custom color profile or preset that adjusts the hue, saturation, and luminance (HSL) of your image files to match the colors of the target card. This way, you can ensure that your photos have consistent and accurate color regardless of the camera and lens you use.
 
## How to Use Spyder Checkr 24?
 
To use the Spyder Checkr 24, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Take photos: Take at least one photo in RAW format including the Spyder Checkr 24. It can be held or placed in the frame. It is important that the target be lit evenly, ideally from each side at 45 degree angles.
2. Install and activate: Install the Spyder Checkr software from the Datacolor website. After the installation is complete, launch the Spyder Checkr software to begin the activation and registration process. This will automatically start your warranty. Use the serial number included in your Spyder Checkr 24 package to activate your software.
3. Calibrate monitor: Make sure your monitor is calibrated. Using your SpyderX colorimeter, perform an initial calibration, or recalibration if you havenât calibrated your monitor within the last four weeks.
4. Adjust in editing software: Upload the image file onto your computer and open it in your RAW conversion software, such as Adobe Lightroom Classic, Adobe Photoshop, or Hasselblad Phocus. Straighten, fix distortion, and crop the target image.
5. Save and apply preset: To use directly from Lightroom Classic, right click on the target image and select âEdit In SpyderCHECKRâ. To use with Camera Raw, save the target image as an uncompressed .tiff file. To use directly from Phocus, export the target image as a 16-Bit .tiff file then choose âSpyderCHECKRâ as the export destination. Launch the Spyder Checkr software and open the target image. Adjust the patch indicators as needed until the patch grid aligns as close to the center of each patch of the Spyder Checkr 24 image as possible. Select your preferred color mode and the application you want to export to, then click âSave Calibrationâ. Type the file name you want to assign to the preset created. (It is suggested to use a naming system that includes the camera model, lens, calibration mode, and Spyder Checkr chart. For example, if you calibrate a Nikon D810 with an 85mm lens for Portrait Mode with the Spyder Checkr 24, a file name such as âD810\_85\_portrait\_24â would be optimal.) Launch your editing software, adjust the white balance with the other side of the Spyder Checker 24, a Spyder Cube, or another gray reference, and apply the preset you have made to all photos taken for the camera and lens combination.
